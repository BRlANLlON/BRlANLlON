Hello! My name is Brian and I am a 22 year old college studuent.
I'm interested in art, music, videogames, bushcraft, and anything that involves creative thinking and building.
I'm currently learning python to create guis and am working on a Minecraft Crafting Guide that has a searchable menu for crafting recipes. 
My goals in the future is to one day create and design videgames, software, or application that can inspire and encourage creativity for the user and allow 
the user to follow through with those ideas.

You can reach me at brian.mendoza.12102000@gmail.com 
(this is my personal/important email so please don't spam)
